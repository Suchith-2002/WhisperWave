# WhisperWave: An Audio Transcription App

WhisperWave is a lightweight web application that allows you to upload an audio file and get a text transcription of the audio. This project is built using **Flask** for the backend and leverages **OpenAI's Whisper** model for highly accurate speech-to-text transcription. It also uses **Pydub** to handle audio file processing.

## üìã Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have **Python 3.x** and `pip` installed.

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Suchith-2002/WhisperWave.git](https://github.com/Suchith-2002/WhisperWave.git)
    cd WhisperWave
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    The project uses the `pydub` and `whisper` libraries. You will also need to install `ffmpeg`, as `pydub` depends on it for audio processing.

    ```bash
    pip install Flask pydub
    pip install openai-whisper
    ```

    **Install FFmpeg:**

    * **On macOS** using Homebrew:
        ```bash
        brew install ffmpeg
        ```
    * **On Windows**: Download the FFmpeg binaries from the official website and add them to your system's PATH.
